SSGS (Spectral-State Guided Synthesis) is a hybrid generative audio model that
combines **linear predictive coding (LPC)**, **hidden Markov models (HMMs)**,
**spectral clustering**, **global graph search**, and a **physically-inspired
Karplus–Strong excitation engine** into a single synthesis framework.

Unlike classical systems that commit to a single paradigm (neural, statistical,
or physical), SSGS deliberately **smashes algorithms together** and extracts the
useful computational primitives from each.  
The result is a model that:

- learns spectral structure from real signals,  
- organizes that structure into Markov states,  
- decodes the optimal state trajectory over time via A* search,  
- generates excitation signals using string-model dynamics, and  
- reconstructs audio by filtering excitation through LPC envelopes.

SSGS is not meant to imitate any existing model family.  
It is a new hybrid class: detailed like DSP, global like HMMs, and expressive like
physical models.

## Key Idea: “Algorithm Deconstruction”
SSGS is built using the same philosophy behind the Symbo project:

> **Break apart many algorithms, strip them to their mathematical essence,
> recombine only the primitives that are actually useful.**

Instead of inheriting algorithms whole (e.g., a standard HMM, standard LPC vocoder,
standard Karplus–Strong), SSGS takes:

- LPC → spectral envelope representation  
- HMM → temporal clustering + statistical state transitions  
- EM → unsupervised parameter refinement  
- A* search → globally optimal state sequence  
- Karplus–Strong → natural resonance and excitation noise  
- Heuristics → spectral smoothness constraints  
- Graph theory → prune invalid or degenerate state structures  

SSGS then recomposes these pieces into a **single generative pipeline that didn’t
exist before**.

This approach is extremely flexible:
swap the envelope model, swap the excitation, modify the search heuristic — the
system keeps working.

## Pipeline Overview

### **1. LPC Analysis**
The training signal is segmented and analyzed with LPC to extract:

- LPC coefficients  
- excitation residual  
- power envelope

These become the feature vectors for clustering.

---

### **2. Spectral Clustering via HMM Initialization**
Frames are embedded into a feature space (typically derived from LPC spectra).
States are initialized using **k-means**, then upgraded into a full **HMM** with:

- initial state distribution  
- transition matrix  
- mean vectors and covariance matrices for each state

---

### **3. Expectation-Maximization (EM) Refinement**
A custom EM implementation updates:

- state responsibilities (γ)  
- pairwise transitions (ξ)  
- transition probabilities  
- Gaussian parameters (means, covariances)

Result: the HMM becomes a structured map of repeating spectral “modes.”

---

### **4. Graph Constraint Pruning**
To prevent degenerate solutions, SSGS analyzes the transition graph:

- identifies strongly connected components (SCCs)  
- removes invalid or isolated states  
- ensures state sequences remain musically plausible

---

### **5. Global State Decoding (A* Search)**
Instead of using Viterbi (which is greedy and purely local), SSGS uses **A***:

- cost function = negative log-likelihood + spectral smoothness heuristic  
- ensures global consistency in the decoded state path  
- supports long-range structure better than classical decoding

---

### **6. Physically Inspired Excitation**
The decoded state sequence modulates a **Karplus–Strong** string model,
producing a dynamic excitation that is:

- rich in overtones  
- noisy where appropriate  
- resonant and evolving

---

### **7. LPC Synthesis**
Finally, excitation is passed through the LPC filters of each decoded state:

- reconstructs spectral envelopes  
- restores formants and resonances  
- yields new but structurally coherent audio

This is how SSGS generates *novel signals* even from short or simple training data.

## Example Output

SSGS produces time-domain and spectral visualizations like this:

The generated signal is not a copy —  
it is a **new trajectory** through learned spectral states.

## Testing

Run the included test script:

```bash
python test_ssgs.py
```

It will:

train the model on a synthetic test signal

generate a new signal

plot time-domain and spectral comparison

save or display diagnostics
